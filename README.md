# Chell: Query-Driven Debugging for Small Language Models

**Chell** is an interactive, query-driven debugging system that helps Small Language Models (SLMs) fix logical errors in Python code. It focuses on data analysis tasks using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Detects logical errors in code
- Asks clarification questions before fixing
- Uses small language models for lightweight debugging
- Modular design for easy extension
